					<h2>Our Values</h2><br>
						<p>We are proud to mention that many students of the Minu/ president’s college were lucky enough to add values to their life by means of scout, since the year 2010 and it will continue to be so. Our ambitions and efforts are directed towards making a scout, who bound with mother nature. Our journey was not an easy way, but we are sure that with the experiences of more than 10 yrs and continuous progress, our goal of success isn’t too far. We are dedicated to making a better world through a scout. The ultimate goal of our scout team is to build up a better person for that better world.</p>
